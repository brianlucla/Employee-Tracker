# Employee-Tracker
A command line application that takes in user input to create a database of employees using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL

## Description

This project creates a command line interface for companies to view and update department, role, and employee information through command line input. I built this project in order to help companies easily view and update their database. From this project, I learned how to use sequelize and SQL, as well as how to use those with user input from inquirer. 

## Installation

To run this project, the user must run "npm i" in command line to install the required packages. After running this, they will have to run "node index.js" to start the program.

## Usage

Simply follow the inquirer prompts to add or view data after the program has started.
